// The tunnel registry.
//
// A backgrounded tunnel outlives the mu that made it: the ssh master persists, the job keeps
// running, and the process that knew about both is gone. So the facts that make it
// closeable — which job, on which system, through which control socket, on which port — have
// to survive on disk. That file IS the tunnel, as far as `ls` and `close` are concerned.
//
// State, not cache: losing it doesn't cost a re-fetch, it strands a running job and a held
// port with no handle on either. Hence XDG_STATE_HOME, not XDG_CACHE_HOME.

// tunnelRec is one live tunnel. ID is mu's OWN handle, minted at submit — not the scheduler
// job id, which mu doesn't know until after submit and which is clumsy to type. It's the
// registry key, the name the job wears in the queue, and what you pass to `close`.

	Job        string    `json:"job"`         // scheduler job id

	Target     string    `json:"target"`      // ssh target of the login node
	Sock       string    `json:"sock"`        // the ssh ControlMaster socket

	Walltime   string    `json:"walltime"`    // as requested; "" when the script decided
	Script     string    `json:"script"`      // "" in adopt mode; the staged path when Staged
	Staged     bool      `json:"staged"`      // mu pushed Script here, so `close` removes it
	Started    time.Time `json:"started"`
	// Running is when the job reached R, which is when its walltime clock starts — Started is
	// the submit, and the queue wait between them can be long. Only this one dates the job's
	// death (see expired); zero on records written before it existed, and in adopt mode it's
