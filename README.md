--
Bash scripts to improve workflow on an HPC center High Performance Computers (HPCs).

> **NOTE:** You should contact the HPC Helpdesk to change your shell to bash.

## Installation <a name='install'></a>
To install the HPC scripts, first clone this repository to a directory
of your choice on the HPC

    user@hpc: cd path/of/your/choice
    user@hpc: git clone https://github.com/mayhl/mayhl_utils.git
    
After cloning the repo, go to your home directory and use the editor of your choice to modify your .bashrc or .bash_profile file.

    user@hpc: cd $HOME
    user@hpc: vim .bashrc
    
To your .bashrc/.bash_profile, add the following lines

    export HPC_CMDS_PATH=path/of/your/choice
    source $HPC_CMDS_PATH/main.sh
    

## SSH to new HPC <a name='hpc_swap'></a>
While connected to an HPC, you can ssh to a new HPC by using the HPC name, e.g., 

    user@login1: node3

> **NOTE:** Nested tunnels do not work.

## Copying files between HPCs <a name='rsync'></a>
Files are copied between HPCs via [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/). Two commands are created for each HPCs: cpName, copy from HPC 'Name' to current HPC; and cp2Name, copy to HPC 'Name' from current HPC. For example:

    user@login1: cpNode3 /path/node3/file /path/jim/file
    user@login1: cp2Node3 /path/node3/directory /path/jim/directory 

## Quick Tar <a name='qtar'></a>

To quickly put a folder into a tarball or extract the files from a tarball (with or without compression using gzip), two wrapper commands *qtar* (no compression) and *gtar* (with compression). The commands will check for the file extension *.tar* (no compression) or *.tar.gz* to determine if tar should be in extract mode. Examples of using these commands are,

    user@hpc: qtar FOLDER
    user@hpc: gtar ARCHIVE.tar.gz

> **NOTE:** In extraction mode *gtar* and *qtar* are equivalent. 

#### Background Mode
For larger folders/archives, the commands  *bqtar* and *bqtar* execute their respective commands in the background in a low-priority mode. Outputs from the commands with be piped to a *.log* file.

> **NOTE:** Low-priority mode applies the nice -20 command

#### Python & tqdm   

If the Python package [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) is available, *qtar* and *gtar* will provide progress bars. The Python [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module provides a method to set up virtual environments for installing custom Python packages. An existing virtual environment can be added to the config.sh file, e.g., 

    HPC_PYTHON=python
    HPC_PY_VENV=/path/to/venv

An example of the extended output with tqdm is below,

    user@hpc: gtar FOLDER
    Processing:  31%|███            |  112M/365M [00:05<00:15, 17.2MB/s]
    Compressed:   7%|█              | 24.8M/365M [00:05<01:21, 4.38MB/s]

> **NOTE:** The Compressed progress part will not fill up but gives the size of the compressed archive.

## Quick Portable Bash Script (PBS) File <a name='pbs'></a>
    
Numerical simulations on the HPCs are queued to be executed on an HPC using a PBS file. A PBS file typically has two overall parts:

1. A header containing information describing the resources to be used.
2. As script setting up the numerical simulation and executing it.

When a PBS file is submitted to the HPC, a Job ID is returned to identify the submission.  

#### *\$HOME* and *\$WORKDIR*

On Alpha HPCs, user files are located in the *\$HOME* directory with limited storage (quota). The *\$WORKDIR* is a temporary storage location with no quota, where older files are periodically deleted. Typically, this location is used to store the outputs from numerical simulations.

#### File Structure Mirroring

To simplify the data movement between *\$HOME* and *\$WORKDIR*, the current directory where the job was submitted from (typically the path containing the input/drive files) in *\$HOME* is mirrored to *\$WORKDIR*. In addition, the Job ID is attached as a suffix to the folder where as well as letter identifying the HPC system, e.g.,

    $HOME/path/to/simulation
    
is mirrored to 

    $WORKDIR/path/to/simulation_j12345
    
where 'j' is an abbreviation of Jim and '12345' is the Job ID returned from the PBS submission.

#### Workflow
The workflow for the PBS file generated is as follows:

1. Starting from a directory in the user's *\$HOME* folder containing the simulation's input/driver files.
3. The PBS file is submitted, queuing the script to be executed.
4. The PBS file will copy the input/driver files from *\$HOME*  to the mirror directory in the *\$WORKDIR*.
5. The numerical simulation is output written to the mirrored path in *\$WORKDIR* (or some subdirectory)

#### Quick Generation 

Quick-generation commands can be created for various numerical models. In the config.sh file, new models can be added by modifying the variable, *PBS_MODELS*, e.g.,  

    PBS_MODELS="Fun WW3"

will generate commands for FUNWAVE and WaveWatch3. For each model, two commands will be created: *mkMdlPBS* and *qmkMdlPBS*, where *Mdl* is the model name in *PBS_MODELS*, e.g., 

    mkFunPBS
    
For each model, a parameter specifying the path containing the executable(s) must be added to the config.sh file. For example

    MDL_EXEC_DPATH=/path/to/folder/with/executable

> **NOTE:** The prefix in *EXEC_PATH* will be the capitalization of the model name in *PBS_MODELS*

The *qmkMdlPBS* command is a quicker way to generate a PBS file. In the config.sh file, several new parameters need to be defined:

    MDL_DEFAULT_EXEC='exectuable name'
    MDL_DEFAULT_SUBPROJ='subproject code'
    MLD_DEFAULT_QUEUE='queue'
    MLD_DEFAULT_INPUT='driver/input files'
    MDL_DEFAULT_WALL='simulation (real) wall time'

In addition, *qmkMldPBS*, has optional arugments 

    qmkMldPBS JOB_NAME NUMBER_OF_THREADS FILE1 FILE2 FILE3 ... 
    
where: 

1. *JOB\_NAME* is the name of the job.
2.  *NUMBER\_OF\_THREADS* is the number of threads (not nodes). The command will automatically select the correct number of nodes and MPI threads. 
3. FILE1, FILE2, ... are additional input/driver files to include on top of the file(s) defined in *MDL\_DEFAULT\_INPUT*.

> **NOTE:** *mkMdlPBS* will accept the same parameters; however, will not lead to a complete PBS file. 
 
## Swapping Between Mirrored Paths<a name='swap'></a>

To make working between the *\$HOME* and *\$WORKDIR* easier, the command *swap* changes between mirrored paths, e.g.,

    user@hpc: pwd
    $HOME/current/path/
    user@hpc: swap
    user@hpc: pwd
    $WORKDIR/current/path
    
> **NOTE:** If the current path is a simulation in *\$HOME*, multiple folders may exist in *\$WORKDIR* (i.e., mirrored paths with suffixes corresponding to the HPC and job ID); therefore, the swap command will cd into to the parent directory containing the simulation runs. 

> ### TODO 
1. Create a Makefile to automate installation and create a basic user config file.
2. Add Job ID list when swapping to *\$WORKDIR* for the simulation folder (instead of going to the parent folder)
3. Add quick archive commands 
4. Fix ToC links
